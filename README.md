# Satellite Rooftop Counter

![Satellite Rooftop Counter](https://link-to-your-image.com)

## Overview
The Satellite Rooftop Counter is a Python-based software tool designed to automatically count the number of rooftops in satellite images. It employs computer vision techniques to analyze satellite imagery and extract information about rooftops, enabling efficient and accurate counting.

## Key Features
- Automated rooftop counting: The code utilizes advanced image processing algorithms to identify and count rooftops in satellite images without manual intervention.
- Support for multiple image formats: The code supports various common image formats, allowing flexibility in working with different types of satellite imagery.
- Configurable parameters: The code provides adjustable parameters to fine-tune the rooftop detection process according to specific requirements or image characteristics.
- High accuracy and reliability: Leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, the algorithm achieves high accuracy and reliability in rooftop identification and counting.
- Scalability: The code is designed to handle large datasets of satellite images efficiently, enabling processing of multiple images in parallel for improved scalability.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/satellite-rooftop-counter.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Place your satellite images in the `images` directory.
2. Configure the parameters in the `config.py` file as per your requirements.
3. Run the script: `python count_rooftops.py`
4. The program will process the images and display the results, including the count of rooftops.

## Example
```python
import cv2
from rooftop_counter import RooftopCounter

# Load an image
image_path = 'images/satellite_image.jpg'
image = cv2.imread(image_path)

# Create a RooftopCounter object
counter = RooftopCounter()

# Process the image and get the rooftop count
rooftop_count = counter.count_rooftops(image)

# Display the result
print(f"The image contains {rooftop_count} rooftops.")
```
